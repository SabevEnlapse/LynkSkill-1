## Executive Summary

This comprehensive link-building strategy addresses the critical need to increase domain authority, improve search rankings, and drive relevant traffic to LynkSkill. Building upon the on-page content optimization work, this strategy focuses on acquiring high-quality, white-hat backlinks from authoritative sources in education, career development, and Bulgarian business ecosystems.

**Key Priorities:**

1. **Educational Institution Links** - Secure partnerships with Bulgarian universities for authoritative .edu/.bg links
2. **Content Marketing Assets** - Create linkable assets that naturally attract backlinks
3. **Local Business Directory Links** - Establish presence in Bulgaria-specific business directories
4. **Industry Association Links** - Build relationships with IT, marketing, and design associations
5. **Digital PR & Media Coverage** - Secure press mentions and features in Bulgarian tech publications

**Expected Impact:**

- **Domain Authority (DA) Increase:** From current baseline to 30-40 within 12 months
- **Organic Traffic Growth:** 200-300% increase through improved search rankings
- **Referral Traffic:** 50-100 new referring domains from relevant sources
- **Brand Visibility:** Increased presence in Bulgarian education and career ecosystems
- **Lead Generation:** Higher quality traffic from targeted sources

**Strategic Approach:**

This strategy emphasizes white-hat, sustainable link-building techniques that align with Google's quality guidelines. We focus on relationship building, content value creation, and genuine partnerships rather than manipulative tactics. The approach is phased, allowing for resource optimization and measurable progress tracking.
